## Key Performance Questions
- What is the total number of page views?
- How much was spent on advertising?
- How many page views were achieved for each dollar spent on ads?
- Which days of the week performed better than others?
- How do holidays impact page views, positively or negatively? 
- What has been the yearly average of page views achieved per dollar of ad spend?
- Dashboard Interaction [View Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/ROASbardashdash2/Dashboard2?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

 ## Analysis Process

## Project Insights
-  Page views per ad dollar performance remains fairly consistent between 6.0 - 6.5 across months.
-  There are slight dips mid-year (June, September, November) but no drastic declines.
-  Holidays amplify traffic during the start and end of the week, but not consistently on Fridays.
-  Thereâ€™s a weekly traffic wave pattern: High on Sun/Mon, dips mid-week, rebounds Sat.

## Final Conclusion
To maximize marketing efficiency and drive higher returns, it is recommended to strategically allocate ad spend toward high-performing days, specifically Sundays, Mondays, and holiday Saturdays where user engagement consistently peaks. Given the weaker performance on Fridays, especially during holidays, reducing ad spend on these low-return days and reallocating that budget to stronger-performing periods will improve overall efficiency. Continuous monitoring of page views per dollar is essential to detect shifts in user behavior, while leveraging holiday periods through targeted campaigns can amplify traffic impact. By aligning ad investments with these clear engagement patterns, the marketing strategy will achieve greater cost-effectiveness and deliver enhanced campaign performance.
